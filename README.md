# **`Mongo Scraper`**

## *The New York Times*

## `Getting Started`

This application scrapes the New York Times homepage for articles that contain a title, link and summary text. You may attach notes to any article listed. In addition, articles may be saved, which are then listed on a separate page. Additional scraping will not return any duplicate stories, and all articles may be deleted, along with their associated notes.

## `Packages and Technologies`

Articles and notes are stored as objects within a MongoDB database.
This application uses the following NPM packages:
* body-parser
* cheerio
* express
* express-handlebars
* mongoose
* morgan
* request
